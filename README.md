# prescription-refusals
BMCM math modeling competition - investigating the impact of pharmacies refusing to fill certain prescriptions (e.g. abortion pills) for vulnerable populations in North Carolina.

Data in the data/ folder was compiled by Christine Tseng.

You'll need an api key from the Census Bureau - see the jupyter notebook - keep that in prescription-refusals/censuskey.txt.
